- ...

# What is a hackathon?

"A hackathon is a design sprint-like event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, **collaborate** intensively on software projects.
The **goal** of a hackathon is to **create usable software or hardware** with the goal of creating a functioning product by the end of the event. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API, or the subject and the demographic group of the programmers. In other cases, there is no restriction on the type of software being created."

# What is an Unseminar?

An “Unseminar” is a **participant-driven meeting**, a shorter version of an “unconference”. The content and structure of the events is driven by you! 
Unlike offering yet-another-seminar (yuck!), an unseminar offers **interactivity** amongst all participants.

# HUB (Heidelberg Unseminars in Bioinformatics)

We’ve been running almost thirty unseminars (2012-2019) as part of HUB - Heidelberg Unseminars in Bioinformatics which is a registered Club (gemeinnütziger eingetragener Verein in Heidelberg) aiming at fostering communication between scientists in the natural sciences.

- Heidelberg
- Budapest
- Berlin
- Norwich
- Cape Town
- as part of conferences such as VizBi or ISMB

# Tools

## Website/Wiki
Having a central server to announce, discuss, prepare and **share** information helped a lot (we used Mediawiki/Wordpress which worked great, but there are probably better tools these days...).
Etherpads can be useful too...

## Mailinglist, Twitter

Useful for getting/keeping in touch with people interested in such events.

## Verein

Helped dealing with money issues (financing the server, buying stationaries etc).
Took some effort to get set up (legal stuff).

# Outcomes: great Community

 - people **having fun** organizing and/or participating in these events

 - people h**elp each other **with problems at work

 - people l**earn **from each other (organized workshops)

 - people finding jobs in labs of other HUB members

# Outcomes: two "scientific Publications"

Collaboratively writing an article about organising unseminars/unconferences in bioinformatics such as:

 - ["Biggest challenges in bioinformatics."](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23492829) (PMID:23492829 PMCID:PMC3615659)
 - ["Ten simple rules for organizing an unconference."](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25633715) (PMID:25633715 PMCID:PMC4310607)

# Software Carpentry

Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been **teaching** researchers the **computing skills** they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. 
Our **volunteer instructors** have run **hundreds** of events for more than **34,000**
researchers since 2012. All of our lesson materials are **freely reusable** under the Creative Commons license.

# Open Life Science Mentoring Program

![](images/OpenLifeScience.png){ width=100% }

This is a 15-week long personal mentorship/training program

- sharing and gaining knowledge essential to create, lead, and sustain an Open Science project
- connecting with members across different communities & backgrounds
- empowering each other to become effective Open Science ambassadors in their communities

## About Bio-IT 

The Bio-IT Project aims to **develop** and **strengthen** the bioinformatics **community** at EMBL Heidelberg,
to **encourage collaborations**, and to provide a forum for discussion of issues and ideas relevant to bioinformatics.
It is made up of members across a range of disciplines in computational biology, in different Units and Core Facilities. . 

- organisation and delivery of **training courses** such as this one
- provision of **one-to-one** training and consultancy
- organisation of social and **networking events** for the computational biology community
- regular **meetings** to discuss issues and ideas
- development and maintenance of the Bio-IT Portal <http://bio-it.embl.de>

# Coding Club 

## What is a Coding Club?

In their original format, club meetings provided attendees with a **calm** and
**productive environment** in which to **study and work**, setting their own pace and
choosing their own topics to explore. Experienced volunteers acted as tutors,
offering guidance and help as needed.

The EMBL Coding Club is an initiative to support the continued study and
practice of computational biology by EMBL researchers of all backgrounds,
especially those with limited programming experience.

# User Group ex. EMBL Python User Group (EPUG)

![](images/epug.png){ width=40% }

This is a collective of python programmers at EMBL HD who meet regularly to discuss python-related topics, demonstrate tools and modules, and experiment with python-related soft- and hardware. It’s a friendly group, and the meetings are a great way to get to know some of the other people in the community who use this awesome language.

The idea is that everybody (even the newest coder) has different views, ideas, experiences and we can all learn from each other!

- Sharing information, links, tools, practices etc.
- standard library and tools
- visualization
- interact with hardware using micropython
- ...

Is this concept relevant to YOU?

Let's try this out!

Get together in groups and organize a hypothetical event of your choice
